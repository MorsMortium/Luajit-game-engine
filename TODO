reduce data conversion
Delete camera textures
software textures for software cameras
collision reaction
one draw per rendertype
RENDERER_SOFTWARE only if there are opengl Windows?
-collision functions
-no collision check if no movement (dirty)
-Work Out deprecation
-check SDLInit and OpenGLInit variables before trying to use functions (or start module)
-finish TODOs
-WindowRender Render.ChangeFrom, Render.ChangeTo
-error messages where needed (but no exit if not needed)
performance: Pass Objects only once and Delete when deleted, send when new
             checking everything, but only once (not runtime?)
             multicore Physics
             multicore rendering?
looks: documentation
       shorter lines
functions: sound
           network
