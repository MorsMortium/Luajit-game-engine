collision reaction/functions
max number of devices? (elements ffi new)
-no collision check if no movement
-Work Out deprecation
-check SDL and OpenGL Init variables before using functions (or start module)
-finish TODOs
-error messages where needed (but no exit if not needed)
performance: Pass Objects only once and Delete when deleted, send when new
             multicore Physics
             multicore rendering?
