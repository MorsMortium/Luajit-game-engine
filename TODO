reduce data conversion
collision reaction
max number of devices? (elements ffi new)
-collision functions
-no collision check if no movement
-Work Out deprecation
-check SDL and OpenGL Init variables before using functions (or start module)
-finish TODOs
-WindowRender Render.ChangeFrom, Render.ChangeTo
-error messages where needed (but no exit if not needed)
performance: Pass Objects only once and Delete when deleted, send when new
             checking everything, but only once (not runtime?)
             multicore Physics
             multicore rendering?
looks: documentation
       shorter lines
functions: sound
           network
